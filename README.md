## 🛠️ Getting Started (Detailed)
## 1️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```
## 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## 3️⃣ Run the Application
```bash
python run.py
```
## 🤖 Using AI-Powered Recommendations
Enable Gemini AI (Optional but Recommended)

**Step 1: Get an API Key**

Get your free API key from Google AI Studio

**Step 2: Configure the API Key**

Using `.env` file (recommended):
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
**Or via environment variable:**
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here   # macOS/Linux
```

## 🧮 Bayes’ Theorem Explained
Bayes’ Theorem updates the probability of a condition after observing new evidence, such as a test result.
### **Formula:**
```java
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) × P(A)] / [P(B|A) × P(A) + P(B|¬A) × P(¬A)]
```
Where:
- **P(A)** → Prior probability
- **P(B|A)** → Sensitivity
- **P(B|¬A)** → False positive rate
- **P(A|B)** → Posterior probability

This project visualizes this shift clearly using charts and explanations.
